\textit{Artificial neural networks are mathematical models that mimic the way the human brain works and are a category of machine learning that uses labeled data to train algorithms to predict outcomes and recognize patterns.
As the use of artificial neural networks becomes more widespread, understanding how they work and their applications is essential in order to keep up with technological developments.
One of the most popular artificial neural network architectures is the multilayer perceptron, but in its application, determining the number of hidden layers becomes a problem because it cannot be determined directly from the data.
Therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze the effect of adding and reducing the number of hidden layers on the accuracy and computation time produced in classification tasks.}
